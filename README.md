# Test Project For RTK
There are two task: Table and Diagram.

I have used a json server to get data for components, 
and you can find task components via names "Table" and "CustomFlow" 

I've tried to compose data with some ill fields to get a little test issues, so 
you can see that in file "db.json".

### TO RUN PROJECT

1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. npm run database 

(you should have newest node.js and npm to work it correctly).

P.S.: This is not such a big project to pack it in Docker :) and 
also to cover with tests in jest and types.
